## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Personal introduction

I am a senior high school student, studying in Changyi No. 1 middle school. I am very busy now

I am now learning markdown language

### My story

In 2022, my city started online classes again because of the epidemic. My best friend xingmouren brought me into contact with hexo and GitHub and began to make my own blog. Because I didn't have any foundation before, I encountered all kinds of difficulties, but Xing helped me solve them every time, so I thank him very much

Now we are about to start school again, so I have to stop updating for a period of time. It is really not easy for my website to stumble today. I believe that in the future, I will get better and better with your support.

See you in the summer vacation

***we'll never walk alone***
