## Hi there 👋

### Personal introduction🙆‍♂️

- 🏫I am a senior high school student, studying in **Changyi No. 1 middle school**. I am very busy now.

- 📕I am now learning **markdown** language.

### My story📜

In 2022, my city started online classes again because of the epidemic. My best friend xingmouren brought me into contact with **hexo** and **GitHub** and began to make my own blog. Because I didn't have any foundation before, I encountered all kinds of difficulties, but **Xing** helped me solve them every time, so I thank him very much.

Now we are about to start school again, so I have to stop updating for a period of time. It is really not easy for my website to stumble today. I believe that in the future, I will get better and better with your support.

See you in the summer vacation~
